I used publcaly available single cell RNA sequencing data from Drosophila ventral nerve cord to identify cell types and genes in the sleep and circadian pathway.

The goal of this analysis was to address the following questions:
1. Are there core clock genes expressed in the ventral nerve cord?
2. Do glia in the ventral nerve cord express clock genes?

Acknowledgement: I am grateful to Stephen Goodwin lab for making this dataset available for the analysis.
